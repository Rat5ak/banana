# Banana Collector Game

A simple web game where you collect bananas, some of which are rare and wear hats.
Rare bananas can be added to your personal collection using the button that appears
next to them. The collection is stored in your browser so it persists between
visits.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and start collecting bananas!
